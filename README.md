Before we call you a programmer, you need to complete some basic tasks.

In this git repository, you will complete the following tasks:

1. Create a hello world python script.
2. Create your own branch. Name it however you would like.
3. Push the script code to the repo.
4. Update your trello board.

To complete this task, I suggest you read up on git branches and how they work.
